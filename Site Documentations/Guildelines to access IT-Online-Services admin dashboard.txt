IT Online Services - Project Setup Guide
Requirements:
XAMPP (Download from https://www.apachefriends.org)

A browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

Step 1: Set Up XAMPP

1. Install XAMPP on your computer.

2. Open XAMPP Control Panel.

3. Start these two modules:

-Apache

-MySQL

Step 2: Place the Project in XAMPP
Copy the entire project folder (e.g. IT-Online-Service) into:

C:\xampp\htdocs\
So your path will look like:  C:\xampp\htdocs\IT-Online-Service\

Step 3: Import the Database

1. Open your browser and go to:

	http://localhost/phpmyadmin
2. Click "New" on the left menu and create a new database:


	Name: contact_form
	Then click Create.

3. With contact_form selected, click on the Import tab.

4. Click Choose File, and select the provided .sql file (should be in your project folder).

5. Click Go to import the tables (this will include the messages table and admin credentials).

Step 4: Login as Admin

1. In your browser, open the login page:

http://localhost/IT-Online-Service/admin_login_handler.php

2. Use the default admin credentials:

	Username: siteadmin

	Password: 123
	(This password is encrypted in the database, so don’t change it manually)

3. After successful login, you’ll be redirected to view all submitted contact messages.

4. Submitting a Message
	Visit the contact page:
	http://localhost/IT-Online-Service/contactus.php

5. Fill out the form and click Send Message.

The message will be saved in the database and viewable from the admin dashboard.

6. Logout and Clear Messages
	From the admin dashboard, you can:

	1. Click Logout to end the session.

	2  Click Clear All Messages to delete all messages from the database.


Notes for Developers/Groupmates

- The project uses PHP + MySQL and runs fully on localhost (no internet required).

- All admin passwords are stored securely using PHP password hashing.

- All form submissions go through JavaScript validation before reaching the database.

- If anyone gets stuck, just double-check:

- Apache and MySQL are running.

- Database is properly imported.

- You're accessing the correct localhost URL.
